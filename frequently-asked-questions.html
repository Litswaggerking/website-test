       <summary class="faq-question">Why did you make a website?</summary>
       <div class="faq-answer">
           <p>Honestly, I've wanted a space to share my creations publicly for a <em>while</em> now. That being said, the decision to learn at least basic web development skills to make this site came after some words of encouragement from the lovely <em>Izzymandias</em>.</p>

       <summary class="faq-question">Have you seen <em>[insert movie/tv show]?</em> / Have you read <em>[insert book]?</em> </summary>
       <div class="faq-answer">
           <p>Very probably not. I am hoping to change this and welcome recommendations, but I tend to consume media at a slower pace than most so don't expect anything from me soon after you've recommended something.</p>

       <summary class="faq-question">Can I join your Minecreaft Realm?</summary>
       <div class="faq-answer">
           <p>(Ages 18-26) If I already know you and you're interested, feel free to contact me about it. That said, Pladsylvania is in a bit of a slump at the moment as most of my time and energy is being directed elsewhere. For this reason, I am not accepting any strangers' requests to join.</p>
           <p>(Under 18 / Over 26) No, unfortunately I'm not accepting new members outside of this age range, in the interest of ensuring a safe and comfortable community for our members.</p>

    <details class="faq-item">
       <summary class="faq-question">Why is your realm on Bedrock? Why don't you switch to Java?</summary>
       <div class="faq-answer">
           <p>There is no 'correct' edition of Minecraft to play on, and quite frankly I'm tired of pretending there is. If you must know, I prefer Bedrock because in my experience it has better performance, accessibility and mechanics overall. No, I'm not interested in debating the topic, if you prefer to play on Java, you go do that.</p>

           <p>My DMs are open! <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="@litswaggerking">Discord</span> is undoubtedly the fastest way to reach me; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Litswaggerking/">Reddit</a> works as well, but I don't check that nearly as frequently so expect a delayed response.</p>
